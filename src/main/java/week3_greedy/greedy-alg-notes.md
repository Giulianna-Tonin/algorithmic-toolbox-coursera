General Strategy
- make a greedy choice 
- Proof that it is a safe move (a moved is called safe if there is an optimal solution consistent with this first move)
- Reduction do Subproblem

Safe moves ex:
- Put max digit first
- Find first occurence of first character
- Cover leftmost point
- Use item with maximum value per unit

Optimazation ex:
- Assume everthing is somehow sorted
- Which sort order is conveniente?
- Greedy move can be faster after sorting
